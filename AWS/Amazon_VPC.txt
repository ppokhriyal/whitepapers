Amazon VPC
==========
Amazon Virtual Private Cloude (Amazon VPC) enables us to launch the AWS resources in a virtual network which we have defined.This Virtual network closely resembles a on premises private network.

Key Components of VPCs
----------------------
a. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
b. Subnet
c. Route tables
d. Internet Gateway
e. VPC endppoint
f. VPC Pearing
g. CIDR Blocks

VPC's and Subnets
-----------------
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to a AWS account.VPC is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.While creating a VPC we need to give IPv4 addreess(Private IP) in the form of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) eg 10.0.0.0/16.

- VPC are Region specific
- In one Region we can have 5 VPCs
- 200 Subnets in one VPC and 200 Route tables.
- In one AWS account we can have 5 Elastic IP's
- Once a VPC is created it automatically creates DHCP,NACL,Security-Group.
- Same CIDR for two different VPC in one account is not allowed.
- The allowed block size of CIDR while creating VPC is between /16 netmask (65536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses)
- Once a VPC is created its CIDR cannot be changed.

VPC CIDR blocks from IPv4 Private address range

a. 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix),eg. VPC must be /16 or smaller (10.0.0.0/16)
b. 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix),eg. VPC must be /16 or smaller (172.31.0.0/16)
c. 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefic),eg. VPC must be smaller (192.168.0.0/20)

After creating the VPC we can create one or more subnets inside a Availability Zones.When we create a subnet we need to give a IPv4 CIDR which is the subset of VPC CIDR block.

- Subnets are Avialability Zone (AZ) specific
- Each subnet should reside in one AZ.
- Subnets can not span AZ's
- Each subnet can have one or more EC2 instances.
- Public Subnets have access to Internet
- Private Subnets don't have access to Internets.
- In order to allow Private Subnet to have access to Internet, we need to create NAT in Public Subnet.
	
The CIDR block of Subnet can have the same CIDR block of VPC (in case of single subnet in the VPC).The allowed block size is /28 and /16 netmask.If we create more than one subnet in a VPC,the CIDR blocks of subnets cannot overlap.

For example, if we create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, it supports 256 IP addresses. We can break this CIDR block into two subnets, each supporting 128 IP addresses. One subnet uses CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other uses CIDR block 10.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255).
