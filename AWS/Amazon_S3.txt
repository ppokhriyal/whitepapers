Amazon S3
=========
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a storage for Internet.Amazon S3 gives a simple web-service interface for storing and retrieving any amount of data,at any time,from anywhere on the web.
- S3 is a object based storage i.e the files are stored as a whole without dividing them into chunks.

Key Concepts
------------
a. Buckets

A bucket is a container for storing the objects.For example if we have a object name example.png stored in a 'examplebucket' in 'us-east-1' region,then its accessable URL will be 'https://examplebucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/example.png':
-- examplebucket, is the bucketname
-- s3, amazon s3 service name
-- us-east-1, region where it is created
-- amazonaws.com, amazon fqdn
-- example.png, object name

- Maximum capacity of a bucket is 5TB
- Folders can be created inside buckets
- Per AWS account we can have 100 buckets
- The number of bucket creation can be increased by submitting a service limit increase

An Amazon S3 bucket is globally unique across the AWS accoount.This means once the bucket is created,the name of the bucket cannot be used by any other AWS account.Once the bucket is deleted its name would be available for new bucket creation.

Bucket Naming Rules
-------------------
- name must be between 3-63 characters long
- name must consists of lowercasee letter,numbers,dots(.) and hypens(-)
- name must begin and end with letter or number
- name in the form of IP address is not allowed

Properties of Buckets
---------------------
- Bucket Versioning
  - Versioning in Amazon S3 means keeping the multiple variants of the objects inside a bucket.
  - Versioning is by default disabled when we create the bucket.
  - Once the versioning is enabled,if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously,it stores all those objects.
  - It helps to recover the ojects which are accidently removed or overwrite.
  - If a object is deleted,Amazon S3 insert a delete marker instead of removing the object and the deleted marker becomes the current object version.
  - Once the bucket is version-enabled it cannot be un-versioned.But we can suspend versioning on that bucket.
  - In suspend versioning all the existing objects that are versioned will remain as it is,only the future requests for the objects will not be versioned.
  - Objects that are stored before the versioning is enabled have version id 'null'.
  - All new objects after the versioning is enabled will have the unique version id.

- Cost Allocation S3 tags
  - In order to track the storage cost of buckets we can add the cost allocation tag.
  - tag is in key-value pair form

- Default server-side encryption
  - Enabling default encryption provides automatic server-side encryption.
  - Amazon S3 encrypts the objects before saving it to a disk and decrypts when we download the object
  - Encryption can be either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer master key (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service
  - Using S3 Batch Operation,we can encrypt the existing objects with a single request.

- Server Access Logging
  - It provides details logs for all the requests that are made to an S3 bucket.
  - By default it is not enabled
  - While enabling the server access log, we need to give the source bucket name which logs will be stored in target bucket
  - source and target buckets should be in same Region

  Points to consider before enabling server access log
  - We can grant permission to deliver access logs through bucket access control list not via bucket policy
  - Deny condition to a bucket policy will prevent from delivering access logs
  - Only Default encryption is allowed SSE-S3
  - S3 Object-lock can not be enabled on target bucket

- Event Notifications
  We can enable certain Amazon S3 Bucket events to send notification messages to a destination whenever the event occurs.

- S3 Transfer Acceleration
  Speed up the data transfer to and from S3 by 50-500% for long distance transfer of large objects.

- S3 Object Lock
  - With Object lock we can manage objects using a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model.
  - Object lock helps us to prevent objects being deleted or overwritten for a fixed period of time or for indefinet period of time.
  - It works as a another layer of protection.
  - It provides two ways of managing the object retention
    - retention period , object is locked for a specific period of time.
    - legal hold, it provides same protection as retention,but it has no expiration date.Legal hold need to remove explicitly.
  - Object locks works only on versioned buckets
  - When lock is applied on the version object,S3 stores the lock information in the metadata for that object only.
  - If we put an object into a bucket that has the same key name as an existing protected object, Amazon S3 creates a new version of that object,
    stores it in the bucket as requested, and reports the request as completed successfully.
    The existing protected version of the object remains locked according to its retention configuration.

- Requester Pays
  - In general bucket owner pays for all the S3 storage and data transfer costs.
    However we configure Buckets to be a Request Pay bucket,where the requester need to pay for the objects which he needs to download.
  - Once the Requester Pays is enabled on the bucket,anonymous access to that bucket is not allowed.
  - All the requester need to be authenticated.

- Accessing Bucket
  - A bucket can be accessed via path-style or virtual-hosted-style URL
  - path-style : https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mybucket/example.png
  - virtual-hosted-style: https://mybucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/example.png


b. Objects

Objects consists of object data and metadata.The object data are opaque to Amazon S3 and metadata is the set of name-value pair that describes the objects.The default metadata are, date last modified and content-type.

c. Keys

A key is the unique idenifier for an object within the bucket.Every object in a bucket have exactly one key.

d. Regions

We can choose the AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket which we intend to create.

Storage Class for Frequently Accessed Objects
---------------------------------------------
For performance-sensitive (where object access time is in milliseconds) and frequently accessed objects,Amazon S3 provides the two type of storage classes :

- S3 Standard : This is the default storage class.If we don't supply the storage class while uploading the objects into the buckets,Amazon S3 assign S3 Standard class to those objects.
- Reduced Redundancy Storage : RRS is designed for those objects,which are noncritical and reproducible data that can be stored with less redundancy.

Storage class for automatically optimizing data with changing or unknown access patterns
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed for optimizing the storage cost by automaically moving the data to the most cost-effective access tier,without any operational overhead.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors the access time patterns and changing of data,and acordingly move the data to cost-effective tier.

- There are no retrieval fees
- Objects that are uploaded to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the Frequent Access tier.
- S3 I-T monitors the access patterns of objects and see those objects are not accessed in last 30 days are moved to infrequent-access tier
- Objects that are not accessed in 90 days are moved to Archived Access Tier
- Objects that are not accessed in 180 days are moved to Deep Archived Access Tier
- S I-T is suitable for objects larger than 128kb
- If the object is delete before the end of 30-days minimum storage duration period,charges are applied for 30-days.

Storage classes for infrequently accessed objects
-------------------------------------------------
The S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes are designed for long-lived and infrequently accessed datas.

- Objects in these storage classes are available in milliseconds
- There is retrieval fee on the objects
- S3 Standard-IA store object data in multiple geographical locations
- S3 Zone-IA store object data in one availability zone

Storage classes for archiving objects
-------------------------------------
The S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes are for low-cost data archiving.

- S3 Glacier, data can be retrived in 1-5 minutes.The minimum storage duration is 90 days.
- S3 Glacier, if a data is deleted,overwritten or transitioned to a different storage class before 90-days,you will charged for 90-days
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive,data can be retrived in 12-hours.The minimum storage duration is 180 days
