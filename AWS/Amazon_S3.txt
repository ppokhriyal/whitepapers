Amazon S3
=========
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a storage for Internet.Amazon S3 gives a simple web-service interface for storing and retrieving any amount of data,at any time,from anywhere on the web.

Key Concepts
------------
a. Buckets

A bucket is a container for storing the objects.For example if we have a object name example.png stored in a 'examplebucket' in 'us-east-1' region,then its accessable URL will be 'https://examplebucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/example.png':
- examplebucket, is the bucketname
- s3, amazon s3 service name
- us-east-1, region where it is created
- amazonaws.com, amazon fqdn
- example.png, object name

- S3 is a object based storage i.e the files are stored as a whole without dividing them into chunks.
- Maximum capacity of a bucket is 5TB
- Folders can be created inside buckets
- Per AWS account we can have 100 buckets

b. Objects

Objects consists of object data and metadata.The object data are opaque to Amazon S3 and metadata is the set of name-value pair that describes the objects.The default metadata are, date last modified and content-type.

c. Keys

A key is the unique idenifier for an object within the bucket.Every object in a bucket have exactly one key.

d. Regions

We can choose the AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket which we intend to create.

Storage Class for Frequently Accessed Objects
---------------------------------------------
For performance-sensitive (where object access time is in milliseconds) and frequently accessed objects,Amazon S3 provides the two type of storage classes :

- S3 Standard : This is the default storage class.If we don't supply the storage class while uploading the objects into the buckets,Amazon S3 assign S3 Standard class to those objects.
- Reduced Redundancy Storage : RRS is designed for those objects,which are noncritical and reproducible data that can be stored with less redundancy.

Storage class for automatically optimizing data with changing or unknown access patterns
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed for optimizing the storage cost by automaically moving the data to the most cost-effective access tier,without any operational overhead.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors the access time patterns and changing of data,and acordingly move the data to cost-effective tier.

- There are no retrieval fees
- Objects that are uploaded to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the Frequent Access tier.
- S3 I-T monitors the access patterns of objects and see those objects are not accessed in last 30 days are moved to infrequent-access tier
- Objects that are not accessed in 90 days are moved to Archived Access Tier
- Objects that are not accessed in 180 days are moved to Deep Archived Access Tier
- S I-T is suitable for objects larger than 128kb
- If the object is delete before the end of 30-days minimum storage duration period,charges are applied for 30-days.

Storage classes for infrequently accessed objects
-------------------------------------------------
The S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes are designed for long-lived and infrequently accessed datas.

- Objects in these storage classes are available in milliseconds
- There is retrieval fee on the objects
- S3 Standard-IA store object data in multiple geographical locations
- S3 Zone-IA store object data in one availability zone

Storage classes for archiving objects
-------------------------------------
The S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes are for low-cost data archiving.

- S3 Glacier, data can be retrived in 1-5 minutes.The minimum storage duration is 90 days.
- S3 Glacier, if a data is deleted,overwritten or transitioned to a different storage class before 90-days,you will charged for 90-days
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive,data can be retrived in 12-hours.The minimum storage duration is 180 days
