Ansible
=======
Ansible is a IT automation tool.It can configure large scale of systems,deploy softwares and zero downtime in rolling out updates.

Unlike other automation tools like Pupet and Chef, Ansible doesn't work with installing the agent on the remote system which need to be managed.

Ansible works on agent-less concept.It communicates with other systems using OpenSSH.

Installation
------------
Ansible is agentless IT automation tool which is installed on a control node.Ansible manages other machines i.e managed nodes via ssh communication.Control node and managed nodes should have ssh service on.Ansible is written in Python progamming language.

Installing Ansible on Ubuntu 20.04
  
- Before we start installing the Ansible package in Control Node,its a good practice to create a new sudo user for Ansible specific tasks.Same user we can have it on the Managed nodes.

- Creating new user for Ansible tasks in Control and Managed node
cmd : useradd -d /home/ansiadmin -m ansiadmin -s /bin/bash

- Set password for 'ansiadmin'
cmd : passwd ansiadmin
      passwd -x -1 ansiadmin

- Switch to 'ansiadmin' user
cmd : sudo -u ansiadmin chsh -s /bin/bash [ in case auto-compilition from Tab not working ]
      su - ansiadmin

- Add 'ansiadmin' to /etc/sudoers
cmd : vim /etc/sudoers
      add below line after root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      ansiadmin ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

- Setup Password less ssh communication between Control node and Managed nodes
  - First create the public key in Conrol node.
  - Public key should be created by new user
  cmd : ssh-keygen -t rsa
        press enter two times
        public key is saved in the Home directory of the new user /home/ansiadmin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

  - Copy the Public key from Control node to Managed nodes
  cmd : ssh-copy-id ansiadmin@hostname_managed_node or ip-address of managed node
        The above command will create .ssh/authorized_keys file in managed node home directory of the user
        which is passed in the above command.The authorized_keys file contains the public key of control node.
